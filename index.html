                    <p>Bicycle Sport was originally opened as Cherokee Cyclery in 1972. After a year on Frankfort Avenue, the shop moved to Breckenridge Lane in St. Matthews. We've been providing trusted products and outstanding service for over forty years. We're pleased to announce that as of March 6th, we are now part of the Scheller's Fitness and Cycling Family! Our store will be closed for the reminder of the month to help us get reorganized with a Grand Re-Opening on April 1. We appreciate all the support and loyalty you've shown Bicycle Sport over the last 40 years, and know that you'll soon feel that same loyalty towards the Scheller Family. While you're waiting for this location to re-open, here are the Scheller's other locations:Bicycle Sport was originally opened as Cherokee Cyclery in 1972.
